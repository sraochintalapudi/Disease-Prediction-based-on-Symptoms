# Disease-Prediction-based-on-Symptoms
Disease Prediction based on Symptoms using Machine Learning Algorithms with User Interface
Machine Learning Bootcamp - A Project based approach

Machine Learning Project from Scrath
Project Title: Disease Prediction based on symptoms using machine learning
Steps:
1.Setup Environment (install Pycharm,pandas,matplotlib,seaborn,Scikit-learn, tkinter)
2.Download Dataset and understand dataset (kaggle)
3.Data preprocessing (removing missing values,encoding)
4.Split the data into training set and testing set(train_test_split function)
5.Choose machine learning algorithm (SVM, GaussianNB, Random Forest)
6.Buid the model (fit function)
7.Predict the results (predict function)
8.Performance analysis (Accuracy score, confusion matrix)
9.Design User Interface (tkinter, Label, Button, Text, Radio Button)
10.Integrate UI and Algorithm
